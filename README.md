Pixelate

Take a picture and watch it pixelate. Use your finger and move it along the screen to change the amount of pixelaization of the image. Sliding your finger to the left side reduces pixelaitation while sliding your finger to the right increases Pixelaization.

App doesn't currently work the way I want it to and is in test build with a preloaded image.
